<h1>!!! IMPORTANT !!!</h1>
<p>
1. Make sure you have the following tables inside your database owned_shops/owned_shops_storage/shops/items/fuel_stations/deliverymissionitems
2. Make sure the items in the shop also exist in your server else the script will give an error out when moving an invalid item from storage or when a player buys it.
3. Make sure you have the items in Config.Items and also in Config.Images as well if the image of the item doesn't exist it is replaced by an image of a box.
4. No support is offered for this script anymore if you wish to use it you have to configure it yourself
